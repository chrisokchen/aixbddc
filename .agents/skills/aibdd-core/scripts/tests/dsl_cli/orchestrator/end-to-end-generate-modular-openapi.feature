  Rule: 後置（狀態）- modular joinRoom operation 應展開為 3 條 entry 落到 contracts/room.dsl.yml
    Example: invoke + response-success-and-failure + response-readmodel 三 entry name 出現
      Then the file "specs/contracts/room.dsl.yml" contains the text "name: joinRoom.operation-invoke"
      And the file "specs/contracts/room.dsl.yml" contains the text "name: joinRoom.operation-response-success-and-failure"
      And the file "specs/contracts/room.dsl.yml" contains the text "name: joinRoom.operation-response-success-readmodel"

  Rule: 後置（狀態）- invoke entry 應帶候選參數註解，從 resolved request schema 欄位 fan-out
    Example: playerId、roomNo、nickname 三條候選註解出現
      Then the file "specs/contracts/room.dsl.yml" contains the text "#   playerId:"
      And the file "specs/contracts/room.dsl.yml" contains the text "#   roomNo:"
      And the file "specs/contracts/room.dsl.yml" contains the text "#   nickname:"

  Rule: 後置（狀態）- readmodel entry 應帶 resolved response property 候選註解
    Example: roomNo 與 playerCount 候選註解出現
      Then the file "specs/contracts/room.dsl.yml" contains the text "#   roomNo:"
      And the file "specs/contracts/room.dsl.yml" contains the text "#   playerCount:"
